# dwm - dynamic window manager
![dwm logo](dwm.png)

dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


# Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
## Void Linux
  `xbps-install libX11-devel libXinerama-devel libXft-devel fontconfig-devel`

# Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

`make clean install`

# Running dwm
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

`exec dwm`

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

`DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm`

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can use my fork of [dwmblocks](https://github.com/salahdin-ahmed/dwmblocks) or [slstatus](https://github.com/salahdin-ahmed/slstatus) (not being updated) and add something like this to your .xinitrc:

`dwmblocks &`
or
`slstatus &`

# Configuration
The configuration of dwm is done by modifying config.def.h
and (re)compiling the source code.


# To Do
- Patch resize point
- Make it possible to over write always center patch (sometimes I want a specific place for the window to be in but always center patch takes control)
- Patch sticky window indicator
- Add sticky window rule
